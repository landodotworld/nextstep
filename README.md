# Purpose
Time is everything! I love pace execution. Motivated by speed, flexibility, real transformation, fast growth and long term potential.

# About me
It was challenging to live as a teenager away from the city. Today it is a gift to have this farm as our family <a href="https://www.instagram.com/epicoshouse/">life project.</a> <br>
Be confident! Life is easier when one is accepting.

My niece was born, and my family was reborn.<br>
Humans are unique and they can change everything!

My mother had cancer. I was not prepared!<br>
The bigger the problem, the more important it is to follow the process, focus, be creative, believe and hope.

My start-up made me understand the word "overcoming".<br>
We can do more than what we rationally expect. Believe!

Traveling alone allowed me to delve deeper and understand what I really feel and learn much about myself.<br>
First, find the real source of the pain, the real problem and then solve it!

My startup pivoted and shifted to a different strategy. I felt this demanded a different kind of leadership with interests different than mine. <br>
If we are not adding value, we should leave it and let new opportunities happen for everyone! Accept that things change over time.

I don't see myself in everything that happens there, but inside of Berghain you can live with openness and freedom.<br>
Society is standardized and judgmental. Prejudice blocks innovation. There are no formats for success!
