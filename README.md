# About me
My parents house was a nightmare during my youth as it was far from the city centre. During the covid this was the opportunity to bring the whole family together in the construction of our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/epicoshouse/">life project</a>. <br>
Be confident and believe that everything happens with a reason. It's easier to live like this, accepting!

My niece was born and my family was reborn. <br>
Humans are not special, they are unic. There are people who can change everything!

My mother had cancer. I was not prepared!<br>
We cant help if we are in Panic. The more challenging the situations, the more important it is to follow the process, focus on the solution and give space to belief and hope.

Making my start up made me feel the meaning of the word overcoming. <br>
We can do more than what we racionaly expect. Believe!

I traveled 21 days alone in Thailand in the worst phase of my life. Alone and without distractions, we can really go and understand what we really feel and learn about ourselves. <br>
Crucial identify the origin and the problem. Have the courage to leave what makes no sense.

I realized that for various reasons my start up was not going down a path that suited my interests at a given time. I was frustrated, I felt I wasn't adding value and I decided to leave full time and just stay as a non executive.<br>
If we are not adding value leave it allowing you and what you are leaving new oportunities! Accept that things change over time. 

Going to Berghain made me feel, in a pragmatic way, openness and freedom. Not because I identify with everything that happens there, but because no one cares about how you present yourself and live. <br>
Society is standardized and judgmental. Theres a lot of space to find innovation if you get your mind out of this preconceptions. There is no formats for sucess! We are all different, and we can be all valid.

I believe in peace, freedom, dream, transparency, human, learning, pace and super fast progress. Time is everything. If I invest time on it, it's because I really believe on the long term potential. Best of, more flexible and fast execution for real impact and transformation.
