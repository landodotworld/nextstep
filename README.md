# About me
It was challenging to live as a teenager away from the city. Today it is a gift to have this farm as our family <a href="https://www.instagram.com/epicoshouse/">life project.</a> <br>
Be confident! Life is easier when one is accepting.

My niece was born, and my family was reborn.<br>
Humans are unique and they can change everything!

My mother had cancer. I was not prepared!<br>
The bigger the problem, the more important it is to follow the process, focus, be creative, believe and hope.

My start-up made me understand the word overcoming.<br>
We can do more than what we rationally expect. Believe!

Traveling alone allowed me to delve deeper and understand what I really feel and learn much about myself.<br>
First, find the real source of the pain, the real problem and then solve it!

My startup to pivoted and shifted to a different strategy. I felt this demands a different kind of leadership with interests different than mine. <br>
If we are not adding value, we should leave it and let new opportunities happen for everyone! Accept that things change over time.

I don't see myself in everything that happens there, but inside of Berghain you can live with openness and freedom.<br>
Society is standardized and judgmental. Preconception blocks innovation. There are no formats for success! 

My purpose is peace, freedom, dream, transparency, human, learning, pace and superfast progress. Time is everything. If I invest time on it, it's because I really believe on the long term potential. Best of, more flexible and fast execution for real impact and transformation.
